# Veritas Libraries Review

This document tracks our understanding of each library in the Veritas project, including its purpose, dependencies, current state, and potential improvements.

## Analysis Plan

Since this repository is new and not yet in production, we'll focus on thorough analysis before making code changes. Our goal is to ensure each library follows consistent patterns, adheres to best practices, and fulfills its intended purpose.

### Deep Dive Process

For each library, we'll conduct the following steps:

1. **Structure Analysis**
   - Module organization
   - File naming conventions
   - Directory structure
   - Exports and entry points

2. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - TypeScript configuration and type safety
   - Linter errors and warnings
   - Code formatting consistency
   - Unit test coverage

3. **Interface & API Review**
   - Public interfaces and their documentation
   - API design consistency
   - Error handling patterns
   - Input validation approaches

4. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Direct dependencies
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Version compatibility issues
   - Unnecessary dependencies

5. **Pattern Consistency**
   - NestJS module implementation
   - Dependency injection usage
   - Error handling approaches
   - Naming conventions

6. **Documentation Quality**
   - TSDoc/JSDoc presence and quality
   - README files
   - Example usage
   - Architecture documentation

### Documenting Findings

For each library, we'll document:
- Summary of findings
- List of potential issues categorized by severity
- Recommended improvements
- Code examples of both problematic patterns and preferred approaches

Only after completing this analysis phase will we proceed with code changes, prioritizing them based on impact and effort required.

**Current State**:
- Implements the transform-on-ingest pattern
- Contains both `DataConnector` and `SocialMediaConnector` interfaces
- TwitterConnector implements both interfaces
- Has MongoDB schemas for storing narrative insights and trends
- NestJS module structure with proper dependency injection

**Potential Issues**:
- Some TypeScript configuration issues have been addressed recently
- Interface implementation consistency between connectors

**Improvement Opportunities**:
- Ensure consistent implementation of interfaces across all connectors
- Update peer dependencies to match the project's NestJS version

## Analysis Timeline & Priority

1. **First Phase** (High Priority)
   - `shared/types` - Foundation for other libraries
   - `database` - Core data access layer
   - `content-classification` - Central to application functionality
   
2. **Second Phase** (Medium Priority)
   - `ingestion` - Data collection capabilities
   - `analysis` - Insight generation
   - `monitoring` - Operational visibility
   
3. **Third Phase** (Lower Priority)
   - `visualization` - UI components
   - `data-access` - Additional data patterns
   - `sources` - Source management

## General Observations

- The project follows a NestJS architecture with well-defined modules
- Libraries use proper dependency injection and follow NX workspace patterns
- There's a clear separation of concerns between libraries
- TypeScript configuration has been recently updated to improve type safety
- NestJS version compatibility appears to be a focus area
- Transform-on-ingest pattern is implemented for privacy compliance

## Next Steps

1. Begin deep dive analysis of highest priority libraries
2. Document findings for each library in a standardized format
3. Identify common patterns and inconsistencies across libraries
4. Prepare recommendations for standardizing approaches
5. Define best practices to apply across all libraries
6. Create action items for addressing issues (to be implemented after analysis)

## Migration Work

- Content and Content-Classification modules consolidation (see migration-plan.md)
- NestJS version updates and dependency alignment
- TypeScript configuration improvements
