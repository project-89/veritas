# Documentation Audit

This document provides an audit of all documentation in the Veritas project, with recommendations for updates, consolidation, or archiving.

## Status Definitions

- **Current**: Up-to-date with the current codebase
- **Needs Update**: Document is mostly relevant but contains some outdated information
- **Historical**: Document describes past decisions or approaches that are now fully implemented
- **Redundant**: Document content is better covered in other documents
- **In Progress**: Document describes features that are partially implemented
- **Planned**: Document describes future features or changes
- **Unnecessary**: Document describes information that should be self-documenting in the code
