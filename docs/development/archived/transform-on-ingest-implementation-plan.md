## Conclusion

Building the transform-on-ingest architecture from the start in a pre-production environment gives us the advantage of designing for privacy and compliance from day one. By following this implementation plan, we will create a system that provides valuable narrative analysis while inherently protecting privacy and ensuring compliance with platform terms of service.

This approach eliminates concerns about deletion requests by design rather than as an afterthought, creating a more robust and future-proof system.
