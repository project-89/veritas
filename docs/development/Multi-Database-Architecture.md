# Multi-Database Architecture for Veritas

## Overview

This document explains the rationale behind the multi-database architecture in the Veritas system, which uses MongoDB, Memgraph, and Redis for different aspects of data storage and analysis.

## Why Use Multiple Databases?

Veritas uses different database technologies because each offers specific advantages for different aspects of the system. Rather than trying to force a single database to handle all use cases (which would lead to compromises), we leverage the strengths of each database type.

## Database Roles and Responsibilities

### MongoDB: Primary Storage for Anonymized Data

MongoDB is a document database that excels at storing and retrieving discrete documents - perfect for the anonymized data produced by our transform-on-ingest architecture.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Document-Oriented**: Natively stores JSON-like documents which match our `NarrativeInsight` and `NarrativeTrend` objects
- **Schema Flexibility**: Easily accommodates changes to document structure as requirements evolve
- **Query Capabilities**: Powerful query language for filtering and aggregation
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for growing data volumes
- **Indexing**: Efficient indexes for performance optimization
- **Time-Series Collections**: Optimized for time-based data like our insights

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Storing anonymized `NarrativeInsight` documents
- Aggregating data into `NarrativeTrend` documents
- Maintaining entity catalogs and topic relationships
- Supporting time-based queries and analytics

### Memgraph: Relationship Analysis Engine

Memgraph is a graph database that excels at storing and querying complex relationships, which is essential for narrative tracking and network analysis.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Relationship-First**: Native support for connections between entities
- **Path Finding**: Efficient algorithms for finding paths between nodes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Ability to identify patterns in connection networks
- **Network Analysis**: Calculate centrality, influence, and other network metrics
- **Cypher Query Language**: Intuitive language for graph queries
- **Performance**: High-performance for relationship traversal

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Modeling narrative spread networks
- Identifying key influencers and amplifiers
- Detecting narrative branches and merges
- Analyzing information flow patterns
- Finding relationships between seemingly unrelated content

### Redis: Caching and Performance Layer

Redis is an in-memory data store that serves as a caching layer and for temporary data processing.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Speed**: Extremely fast in-memory operations
- **Data Structures**: Rich set of data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets)
- **TTL Support**: Built-in time-to-live functionality
- **Pub/Sub**: Support for message publishing and subscribing
- **Lua Scripting**: Complex operations in atomic scripts
- **Versatility**: Useful for many different performance optimizations

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Managing rate limits and throttling
- Temporary storage during processing
- Session management
- Distributed locks and coordination

## Synergy Between Databases

The power of this architecture comes not just from using each database for what it does best, but from how they work together:

1. **MongoDB â†’ Memgraph Flow:**
   - Anonymized insights are stored in MongoDB
   - Key relationships are extracted and stored in Memgraph
   - Analytical queries use Memgraph for relationship traversal
   - Detailed document data is fetched from MongoDB when needed

2. **Redis Acceleration:**
   - Frequently accessed MongoDB documents are cached in Redis
   - Common graph query results from Memgraph are cached in Redis
   - Processing state during data pipelines is managed in Redis

## Benefits Over Single-Database Approach

### Performance Optimization

Different query patterns have drastically different performance characteristics. Using specialized databases allows us to optimize for each pattern:

- Document retrieval in MongoDB is 10-100x faster than in a graph database
- Relationship traversal in Memgraph is 10-100x faster than in a document database
- In-memory caching in Redis can be 10-1000x faster than either MongoDB or Memgraph

### Data Model Clarity

Each database type encourages proper modeling for its domain:

- MongoDB encourages well-structured documents
- Memgraph encourages proper relationship modeling
- Redis encourages performance-optimized data structures

### Operational Flexibility

Multiple databases provide flexibility in how we manage the system:

- Different scaling strategies for different data types
- Targeted backup and recovery processes
- Specialized monitoring and optimization

### Future-Proofing

This architecture allows for evolution:

- Replace any database component without affecting others
- Add specialized databases for new requirements
- Scale individual components based on actual usage patterns

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Synchronization

One challenge with a multi-database approach is keeping data synchronized. Veritas addresses this through:

1. **Event-Driven Updates**: Changes in MongoDB trigger events that update Memgraph
2. **Batch Synchronization**: Regular processes that ensure consistency
3. **Eventual Consistency Model**: Acknowledging that perfect real-time consistency isn't required for analysis

### Query Routing

The system needs to know which database to query for which data:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access behind repositories
2. **Service Layer Logic**: High-level services determine the appropriate data source
3. **Composite Queries**: Some operations may combine data from multiple sources

### Transaction Management

Since we don't have true cross-database transactions, we need strategies:

1. **Eventual Consistency**: Accept that updates may not be immediately visible everywhere
2. **Compensating Transactions**: Implement rollback mechanisms for failures
3. **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure operations can be safely retried

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Storing and Analyzing a New Narrative Insight

1. **Ingestion Process**:
   - Raw content is transformed to an anonymized `NarrativeInsight`
   - The insight is stored in MongoDB
   - A lightweight graph representation is created in Memgraph
   - Processing status is tracked in Redis

2. **Analysis Query**:
   - User searches for related narratives
   - Memgraph finds relationship patterns
   - MongoDB retrieves full details of matching insights
   - Results are cached in Redis for subsequent queries

### Example 2: Tracking Narrative Evolution

1. **Trend Detection**:
   - MongoDB aggregation identifies emerging topics
   - Memgraph analyzes relationship patterns
   - Redis tracks real-time counts and trends

2. **Visualization**:
   - Network graph from Memgraph shows relationship structure
   - Document details from MongoDB provide context
   - Redis caches the visualization data for performance

## Conclusion

The multi-database architecture in Veritas is a deliberate design choice that leverages the complementary strengths of MongoDB, Memgraph, and Redis. Rather than compromising with a one-size-fits-all approach, this architecture allows each component to excel at what it does best, resulting in a system that is more performant, maintainable, and capable of sophisticated narrative analysis.

This approach aligns perfectly with the transform-on-ingest architecture, where anonymized insights need both document storage (MongoDB) and relationship analysis (Memgraph), with performance optimization (Redis) to ensure a responsive system.
