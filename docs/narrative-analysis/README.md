# Narrative Analysis Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the narrative analysis components and methodologies in the Veritas project.

## Overview

The Veritas project aims to analyze, visualize, and understand how narratives evolve, interact, and influence perception of reality. This documentation outlines the conceptual framework, technical approaches, and implementation tasks for developing a comprehensive narrative analysis system.

## Contents

- [Consensus Reality Determination](./consensus-reality.md): Methods for identifying and measuring consensus reality across different scales
- [Narrative Dynamics](./narrative-dynamics.md): Understanding how narratives evolve, branch, and interact over time
- [Advanced Visualization](./advanced-visualization.md): Technical specifications for 3D and organic visualizations of narrative structures
- [Pattern Projection](./pattern-projection.md): Approaches for modeling future narrative trajectories and outcomes
- [Harmony Metrics](./harmony-metrics.md): Measuring system health and harmony rather than objective truth
- [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md): Prioritized task list for developing these capabilities

## Core Concepts

### Consensus Reality

Consensus reality represents the mainstream, majority-held belief system. It varies across different scales (global, national, local, individual) and evolves over time. Rather than treating it as "objective truth," we understand it as the dominant narrative that serves as a reference point for measuring deviation.

### Narrative Ecosystems

Narratives form living, organic structures similar to neural networks or mycelium. They grow, branch, compete for resources (attention, belief), and sometimes merge or die out. Understanding these dynamics helps us model information ecosystems more accurately.

### System Harmony

Instead of focusing solely on "truth," we measure system health through metrics like diversity of perspectives, information flow, adaptability, and resilience to manipulation. Harmonious systems allow for productive disagreement while maintaining overall stability.

## Vision

The ultimate vision is to create a system that can:

1. Identify and visualize consensus reality at different scales
2. Track living narrative networks as they evolve over time
3. Project potential future states based on historical patterns
4. Measure system harmony and health
5. Suggest interventions that promote healthy information ecosystems

This documentation provides the foundation for implementing this vision within the Veritas project.
