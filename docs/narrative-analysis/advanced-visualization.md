# Advanced Visualization

This document outlines the technical specifications and implementation tasks for developing advanced visualization capabilities for narrative structures within the Veritas system.

## Conceptual Framework

Traditional 2D visualizations are limited in their ability to represent the complex, multi-dimensional nature of narrative ecosystems. Advanced visualization techniques can provide more intuitive and comprehensive ways to understand narrative dynamics.

### Visualization Goals

1. **Organic Representation**: Visualize narratives as living, growing structures
2. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Show relationships across multiple dimensions (time, belief strength, topic space)
3. **Immersive Exploration**: Allow users to "move through" narrative spaces
4. **Intuitive Understanding**: Make complex relationships immediately comprehensible
5. **Dynamic Interaction**: Show how narratives evolve and interact in real-time

## Technical Approach

### 3D Narrative Visualization

1. **Enhanced Reality Tunnel**
   - Extend the existing Reality Tunnel visualization into true 3D space
   - Add branching structures to show narrative divergence
   - Implement depth and perspective for immersive exploration
   - Use color, thickness, and texture to represent additional dimensions

2. **Narrative Mycelium**
   - Create an organic, mycelium-inspired visualization
   - Represent narratives as interconnected, branching structures
   - Show nodes of concentration where narratives gain strength
   - Visualize "rhizome-like" connections between seemingly unrelated narratives

3. **Narrative Landscape**
   - Implement a topographical landscape where:
     - Elevation represents narrative strength
     - Proximity represents narrative similarity
     - Valleys and peaks show consensus and divergence
     - Rivers/paths show information flow

### Implementation Components

#### Technical Requirements

1. **3D Rendering Engine**
   - WebGL-based rendering for browser compatibility
   - Support for complex organic structures
   - Efficient handling of large datasets
   - Animation capabilities for showing evolution

2. **Interactive Navigation**
   - Camera controls for exploring the 3D space
   - Zoom, pan, rotate, and "fly through" capabilities
   - Focus and highlight features for specific narratives
   - Timeline controls for temporal exploration

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Level-of-detail rendering for complex structures
   - Efficient data structures for real-time interaction
   - Progressive loading for large narrative ecosystems
   - GPU acceleration where available

#### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Core visualization component
interface NarrativeVisualizationProps {
  data: NarrativeEcosystem;
  viewMode: '3d' | '2d' | 'vr';
  renderMode: 'mycelium' | 'landscape' | 'tunnel' | 'network';
  dimensions: {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    depth?: number;
  };
  timeframe: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
    current: Date;
  };
  focusedNarrativeId?: string;
  highlightMode?: 'strength' | 'deviation' | 'growth' | 'influence';
  onNarrativeSelect?: (narrativeId: string) => void;
  onTimeframeChange?: (start: Date, end: Date) => void;
  onViewportChange?: (viewport: Viewport) => void;
}

// Mycelium-specific props
interface MyceliumVisualizationProps extends NarrativeVisualizationProps {
  growthSpeed: number;
  nodeSize: number;
  branchingFactor: number;
  organicMovement: boolean;
  showNutrientFlow: boolean;
}

// Landscape-specific props
interface LandscapeVisualizationProps extends NarrativeVisualizationProps {
  elevationScale: number;
  colorMapping: 'heat' | 'categorical' | 'custom';
  showWaterways: boolean;
  terrainResolution: number;
  exaggeration: number;
}

// Reality tunnel enhancements
interface EnhancedRealityTunnelProps extends NarrativeVisualizationProps {
  tunnelDiameter: number;
  branchingAngle: number;
  perspectiveDepth: number;
  showCrossSections: boolean;
  animatePropagation: boolean;
}
```

#### Rendering Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation**
   ```typescript
   function prepareVisualizationData(
     narratives: NarrativeTree[],
     interactions: NarrativeInteraction[],
     renderMode: RenderMode
   ): VisualStructure {
     // Transform narrative data into visual structures
     // Calculate positions, connections, and visual properties
     // Optimize for the selected render mode
     // Return prepared visual structure
   }
   ```

2. **Scene Construction**
   ```typescript
   function buildScene(
     visualStructure: VisualStructure,
     viewport: Viewport,
     renderOptions: RenderOptions
   ): Scene {
     // Create 3D scene with appropriate lighting
     // Position camera and set perspective
     // Add visual elements based on structure
     // Configure interactions and animations
     // Return complete scene
   }
   ```

3. **Animation System**
   ```typescript
   function animateNarrativeEvolution(
     initialState: VisualStructure,
     finalState: VisualStructure,
     timeSteps: number,
     easingFunction: EasingFunction
   ): Animation {
     // Create keyframes for smooth transition
     // Apply easing for natural movement
     // Handle branching and merging animations
     // Return animation sequence
   }
   ```
