# Pattern Projection

This document outlines the approach to modeling future narrative trajectories and outcomes within the Veritas system.

## Conceptual Framework

Understanding how narratives evolve is valuable, but predicting their future trajectories provides even greater insight. Pattern projection uses historical data and identified patterns to forecast potential narrative developments.

### Core Concepts

1. **Trajectory Modeling**: Projecting the future path of narratives based on current momentum and historical patterns
2. **Inflection Point Prediction**: Identifying potential future moments where narratives might significantly change direction
3. **Alternative Scenario Generation**: Modeling multiple possible futures based on different variables
4. **Intervention Simulation**: Testing how specific interventions might alter narrative trajectories
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Assessing the reliability of projections based on data quality and pattern strength

## Technical Approach

### Projection Methodologies

1. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Apply statistical methods to narrative strength over time
   - Identify seasonal patterns and cycles in narrative evolution
   - Project future values based on historical trends

2. **Agent-Based Modeling**
   - Simulate individual actors and their interactions
   - Model how information spreads through networks
   - Observe emergent narrative patterns from simulated behaviors

3. **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation**
   - Identify recurring patterns in narrative evolution
   - Match current narratives to historical precedents
   - Extrapolate future developments based on pattern completion

4. **System Dynamics Modeling**
   - Model feedback loops and causal relationships
   - Simulate how narratives influence and are influenced by other factors
   - Project system-level changes over time

### Implementation Components

#### Data Structures

```typescript
interface ProjectionScenario {
  id: string;
  baseNarrativeId: string;
  timeframe: {
    start: Date;      // Usually the present
    end: Date;        // Projection horizon
    intervals: number; // Number of time steps in projection
  };
  parameters: {
    externalFactors: ExternalFactor[];
    weightings: Record<string, number>;
    confidenceThreshold: number;
    volatilityAssumption: number;
  };
  results: ProjectionResult[];
}

interface ProjectionResult {
  timepoint: Date;
  narrativeState: {
    id: string;
    strength: number;
    activeBranches: number;
    dominantBranchId: string;
    competingNarrativeIds: string[];
  };
  metrics: {
    confidence: number;    // How confident we are in this projection
    volatility: number;    // How much variation exists in possible outcomes
    sensitivity: string[]; // Factors this projection is most sensitive to
  };
  alternativePaths: {
    id: string;
    probability: number;
    description: string;
    divergenceReason: string;
  }[];
}

interface InterventionModel {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  targetNarrativeId: string;
  interventionType: 'information' | 'connection' | 'amplification' | 'counter-narrative';
  parameters: Record<string, unknown>;
  projectedImpact: {
    immediateChange: number;
    longTermChange: number;
    sideEffects: {
      narrativeId: string;
      impact: number;
    }[];
    confidenceScore: number;
  };
}
```

#### Algorithms

1. **Narrative Projection Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function projectNarrativeTrajectory(
     narrative: NarrativeTree,
     historicalData: HistoricalData,
     timeframe: Timeframe,
     parameters: ProjectionParameters
   ): ProjectionResult[] {
     // Analyze historical patterns
     // Apply time series forecasting
     // Account for external factors
     // Generate confidence intervals
     // Return projected trajectory
   }
   ```

2. **Intervention Impact Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function modelInterventionImpact(
     narrative: NarrativeTree,
     intervention: InterventionModel,
     systemState: SystemState
   ): InterventionImpact {
     // Model immediate narrative response
     // Simulate propagation through network
     // Calculate side effects on related narratives
     // Estimate confidence based on similar historical interventions
     // Return projected impact
   }
   ```

3. **Alternative Scenario Generator**
   ```typescript
   function generateAlternativeScenarios(
     baseProjection: ProjectionResult[],
     sensitivityFactors: SensitivityFactor[],
     scenarioCount: number
   ): ProjectionScenario[] {
     // Identify key branching points
     // Vary sensitive parameters
     // Generate alternative trajectories
     // Calculate probability for each scenario
     // Return set of alternative scenarios
   }
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics

To measure the effectiveness of pattern projection:

1. **Accuracy**: How well projections match actual outcomes (measured retrospectively)
2. **Calibration**: Whether confidence scores accurately reflect projection reliability
3. **Usefulness**: How actionable the projections are for decision-making
4. **Responsiveness**: How quickly projections update based on new information
5. **Explanatory Power**: How well the system explains the reasoning behind projections

## Ethical Considerations

Pattern projection raises important ethical considerations:

1. **Self-fulfilling Prophecies**: Projections might influence behavior in ways that make them come true
2. **Misuse Potential**: Projection tools could be used to design manipulation campaigns
3. **Overconfidence**: Users might place too much faith in projections despite uncertainties
4. **Transparency**: The basis for projections should be explainable and transparent
5. **Bias**: Projection systems might inherit biases from historical data

These considerations should be addressed through:

- Clear communication of confidence levels and limitations
- Ethical guidelines for system use
- Transparency in methodology
- Regular bias audits
- User education about proper interpretation of projections
