# Narrative Dynamics

This document outlines the approach to understanding and modeling how narratives evolve, branch, and interact over time within the Veritas system.

## Conceptual Framework

Narratives are not static entities but dynamic, living structures that evolve through various processes. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for modeling information ecosystems accurately.

### Core Dynamics

1. **Emergence**: How new narratives form from existing information and events
2. **Growth**: How narratives gain strength and adoption
3. **Branching**: How narratives split into sub-narratives or alternative interpretations
4. **Merging**: How separate narratives sometimes combine or synthesize
5. **Competition**: How narratives compete for attention and belief
6. **Decay**: How narratives lose relevance and fade

### Biological Metaphors

The dynamics of narratives can be understood through biological metaphors:

1. **Mycelium-like Networks**: Narratives form interconnected networks with nodes of concentration
2. **Neural Pathways**: Narratives strengthen through repetition and reinforcement
3. **Ecosystem Competition**: Narratives compete for limited resources (attention, belief)
4. **Evolutionary Adaptation**: Narratives adapt to changing information environments
5. **Symbiosis**: Some narratives develop mutually beneficial relationships

## Technical Approach

### Modeling Narrative Evolution

1. **Temporal Tracking System**
   - Track narrative elements over time
   - Measure strength, reach, and adoption rates
   - Identify key inflection points in narrative trajectories

2. **Branching Detection Algorithm**
   - Identify when a narrative splits into distinct sub-narratives
   - Measure similarity and divergence between branches
   - Track lineage and inheritance of narrative elements

3. **Interaction Mapping**
   - Model how narratives influence each other
   - Detect reinforcement, contradiction, and synthesis patterns
   - Measure narrative "gravity" (ability to pull other narratives toward it)

### Implementation Components

#### Data Structures

```typescript
interface NarrativeNode {
  id: string;
  parentId?: string;           // For tracking lineage
  rootId: string;              // Original narrative this descended from
  timestamp: Date;
  content: {
    claim: string;
    evidence: string[];
    actors: string[];
    events: string[];
  };
  metrics: {
    strength: number;          // 0-1, current adoption/belief level
    growth: number;            // Rate of change in strength
    deviation: number;         // How far from parent/consensus
    branchPotential: number;   // Likelihood of spawning new branches
  };
  relationships: {
    supports: string[];        // IDs of narratives this one supports
    contradicts: string[];     // IDs of narratives this one contradicts
    extends: string[];         // IDs of narratives this one builds upon
  };
}

interface NarrativeTree {
  id: string;
  rootNode: NarrativeNode;
  branches: {
    [branchId: string]: NarrativeNode[];
  };
  metrics: {
    totalStrength: number;
    branchCount: number;
    depth: number;             // Maximum generations from root
    diversity: number;         // Measure of variation within branches
    competitiveness: number;   // How much internal competition exists
  };
}

interface NarrativeInteraction {
  sourceNarrativeId: string;
  targetNarrativeId: string;
  type: 'reinforcement' | 'contradiction' | 'synthesis' | 'competition';
  strength: number;            // 0-1, how strong the interaction is
  timestamp: Date;
  impact: {
    sourceStrengthChange: number;
    targetStrengthChange: number;
  };
}
```

#### Algorithms

1. **Narrative Evolution Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function evolveNarrative(
     narrative: NarrativeNode, 
     externalFactors: ExternalFactor[],
     timeStep: number
   ): NarrativeNode {
     // Calculate new strength based on current metrics and external factors
     // Determine growth rate changes
     // Update relationship impacts
     // Return updated narrative node
   }
   ```

2. **Branch Detection Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function detectBranches(
     narrativeTimeline: NarrativeNode[],
     contentItems: ContentItem[]
   ): NarrativeBranch[] {
     // Analyze content for divergent interpretations
     // Identify clustering of alternative viewpoints
     // Determine if threshold for new branch is met
     // Return detected branches
   }
   ```

3. **Narrative Interaction Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function modelInteractions(
     narrativeA: NarrativeNode,
     narrativeB: NarrativeNode,
     contentOverlap: ContentItem[]
   ): NarrativeInteraction {
     // Determine interaction type
     // Calculate interaction strength
     // Model impact on both narratives
     // Return interaction details
   }
   ```
