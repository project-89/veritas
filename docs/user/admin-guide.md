## Introduction

The Veritas Administrator Guide is designed for system administrators responsible for managing and maintaining the Veritas platform. This guide assumes familiarity with:

- Linux/Unix system administration
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Database management (particularly graph databases)
- Web application administration
- Basic networking concepts

## System Architecture

Veritas is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture:

### Core Components

- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express RESTful API
- **Graph Database**: Memgraph for storing and querying relationship data
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Message Queue**: Kafka for event-driven processing
- **Object Storage**: For storing large assets and backups
- **Authentication Service**: For user authentication and authorization

### Infrastructure

- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration
- **Load Balancer**: For distributing traffic
- **Ingress Controller**: For routing HTTP traffic
- **Persistent Volumes**: For database storage
- **Secrets Management**: For secure credential storage

### Data Flow

1. Data is collected from sources via the ingestion pipeline
2. Raw content is processed and stored in the graph database
3. Analysis services process the content to detect narratives
4. Results are cached for quick access
5. Frontend applications query the API to retrieve and display data

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS, AKS, or self-managed)
- Helm (for package management)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes management)
- Docker (for local development and testing)
- Domain name and SSL certificates
- Google Cloud Platform account (if using GCP)

### Deployment Options

Veritas can be deployed using:

1. **Terraform**: For infrastructure as code deployment (recommended)
2. **Kubernetes Manifests**: For manual deployment
3. **Helm Charts**: For package-based deployment
