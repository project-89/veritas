# Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure & Core Services

## Overview
This phase focuses on establishing the basic infrastructure on GCP and deploying the core services required for the Veritas system to function at a minimal viable level.

## Infrastructure Setup (2-3 weeks)

### Terraform Configuration
- [ ] Set up Terraform project structure
- [ ] Create GCP project and service accounts
- [ ] Configure remote state storage in GCS
- [ ] Define network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, firewall rules)
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure deployment

### Core GCP Resources
- [ ] Set up GKE cluster for application hosting
- [ ] Configure Cloud SQL for relational database needs
- [ ] Set up Redis instance for caching
- [ ] Configure Cloud Storage buckets for assets and backups
- [ ] Set up Cloud Memorystore for distributed caching
- [ ] Configure IAM roles and permissions

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up Cloud Monitoring
- [ ] Configure Cloud Logging
- [ ] Create basic alerting policies
- [ ] Set up log export to BigQuery for analysis

## Core Services Deployment (3-4 weeks)

### Backend API Services
- [ ] Containerize the NestJS API application
- [ ] Deploy API service to GKE
- [ ] Configure API Gateway/Cloud Endpoints
- [ ] Set up autoscaling policies
- [ ] Implement health checks and readiness probes

### Database Setup
- [ ] Deploy Memgraph on GKE (or evaluate Managed Graph DB alternatives)
- [ ] Configure database persistence and backups
- [ ] Set up database migration process
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and optimization

### Message Queue System
- [ ] Set up Pub/Sub topics for event streaming
- [ ] Configure message schemas and validation
- [ ] Implement dead-letter queues for failed messages
- [ ] Set up subscription services for event processing

### Basic Frontend
- [ ] Containerize the React frontend application
- [ ] Deploy to GKE or Cloud Run
- [ ] Configure Cloud CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up Cloud Storage for media files
- [ ] Implement basic authentication

## Minimal Admin Interface (2-3 weeks)

### Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Develop basic service status monitoring UI
- [ ] Implement simple start/stop controls for services
- [ ] Create data source configuration interface
- [ ] Build basic user management

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement admin authentication and authorization
- [ ] Create service control endpoints
- [ ] Develop configuration management endpoints
- [ ] Build system status reporting endpoints

## Testing & Validation (1-2 weeks)

### Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] Validate infrastructure resilience
- [ ] Test scaling capabilities
- [ ] Verify backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Conduct security assessment

### Application Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of core workflows
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security testing of API endpoints
- [ ] Validation of data persistence

## Deliverables
- Functioning GCP infrastructure managed by Terraform
- Deployed core services (API, database, message queue)
- Basic admin interface for service management
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Documentation of the infrastructure and deployment process

## Success Criteria
- All core services deployed and operational
- Admin can start/stop services through the interface
- System can ingest and store basic data
- Monitoring provides visibility into system health
- Infrastructure can be recreated from Terraform code
