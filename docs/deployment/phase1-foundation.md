# Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure & Core Services

## Overview
This phase focuses on establishing the basic infrastructure on GCP and deploying the core services required for the Veritas system to function at a minimal viable level.

## Infrastructure Setup (2-3 weeks)

### Terraform Configuration
- [x] Set up Terraform project structure
- [x] Create GCP project and service accounts
- [x] Configure remote state storage in GCS
- [x] Define network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, firewall rules)
- [x] Create CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure deployment

### Core GCP Resources
- [x] Set up GKE cluster for application hosting
- [ ] Configure Cloud SQL for relational database needs
- [x] Set up Redis instance for caching
- [x] Configure Cloud Storage buckets for assets and backups
- [x] Set up Cloud Memorystore for distributed caching
- [x] Configure IAM roles and permissions

### Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Set up Cloud Monitoring
- [x] Configure Cloud Logging
- [x] Create basic alerting policies
- [ ] Set up log export to BigQuery for analysis

## Core Services Deployment (3-4 weeks)

### Backend API Services
- [x] Containerize the NestJS API application
- [x] Deploy API service to GKE
- [x] Configure API Gateway/Cloud Endpoints
- [x] Set up autoscaling policies
- [x] Implement health checks and readiness probes

### Database Setup
- [x] Deploy Memgraph on GKE (or evaluate Managed Graph DB alternatives)
- [x] Configure database persistence and backups
- [x] Set up database migration process
- [x] Implement connection pooling and optimization

### Message Queue System
- [x] Set up Pub/Sub topics for event streaming
- [x] Configure message schemas and validation
- [x] Implement dead-letter queues for failed messages
- [x] Set up subscription services for event processing

### Basic Frontend
- [x] Containerize the React frontend application
- [x] Deploy to GKE or Cloud Run
- [x] Configure Cloud CDN for static assets
- [x] Set up Cloud Storage for media files
- [x] Implement basic authentication

## Minimal Admin Interface (2-3 weeks)

### Admin Dashboard
- [x] Develop basic service status monitoring UI
- [x] Implement simple start/stop controls for services
- [x] Create data source configuration interface
- [x] Build basic user management

### API Endpoints
- [x] Implement admin authentication and authorization
- [x] Create service control endpoints
- [x] Develop configuration management endpoints
- [x] Build system status reporting endpoints

## Testing & Validation (1-2 weeks)

### Infrastructure Testing
- [x] Validate infrastructure resilience
- [x] Test scaling capabilities
- [x] Verify backup and restore procedures
- [x] Conduct security assessment

### Application Testing
- [x] End-to-end testing of core workflows
- [x] Performance testing under load
- [x] Security testing of API endpoints
- [x] Validation of data persistence

## Deliverables
- Functioning GCP infrastructure managed by Terraform
- Deployed core services (API, database, message queue)
- Basic admin interface for service management
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Documentation of the infrastructure and deployment process

## Success Criteria
- All core services deployed and operational
- Admin can start/stop services through the interface
- System can ingest and store basic data
- Monitoring provides visibility into system health
- Infrastructure can be recreated from Terraform code
