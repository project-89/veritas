# Veritas System Deployment Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the phased approach for deploying the Veritas system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. The deployment is divided into four phases, each building upon the previous one to create a complete, production-ready system for narrative tracking and analysis.

## Deployment Phases

### [Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure & Core Services](./phase1-foundation.md)

The first phase focuses on establishing the basic infrastructure and deploying the core services required for the Veritas system to function at a minimal viable level.

**Key Components:**
- GCP infrastructure setup with Terraform
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Core database and caching services
- Basic API and frontend services
- Minimal admin interface

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

### [Phase 2: Data Pipeline & Analysis Capabilities](./phase2-data-pipeline.md)

The second phase implements the complete data ingestion pipeline, analysis services, and enhances the admin interface for data source management.

**Key Components:**
- Social media connectors for multiple platforms
- Data processing and enrichment services
- Storage optimization strategies
- Narrative analysis algorithms
- Enhanced admin interface for data management

**Timeline:** 11-15 weeks

### [Phase 3: Visualization & User Interface](./phase3-visualization.md)

The third phase focuses on implementing advanced visualization capabilities, enhancing the user interface, and providing comprehensive tools for narrative analysis and exploration.

**Key Components:**
- Narrative flow visualization components
- Network visualization tools
- Dashboard components and widgets
- User interface enhancements
- Search and discovery features
- User management and access control

**Timeline:** 11-15 weeks

### [Phase 4: Production Readiness & Enterprise Features](./phase4-production.md)

The final phase prepares the system for production deployment, implementing enterprise-grade features, and ensuring the system can scale to handle large volumes of data and users.

**Key Components:**
- High availability infrastructure
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Enterprise security features
- Advanced analytics with AI integration
- Multi-tenancy support
- Performance optimization

**Timeline:** 10-14 weeks

## Infrastructure as Code

The entire infrastructure is defined and managed using Terraform, enabling consistent, repeatable deployments across environments.

### [Terraform Setup Guide](./terraform-setup.md)

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and managing the Terraform configuration for the Veritas system on GCP.

**Key Topics:**
- Project structure
- Core infrastructure modules
- Deployment process
- Environment management
- CI/CD integration
- Cost optimization
- Security best practices

## Getting Started

To begin the deployment process:

1. Review the [Phase 1 documentation](./phase1-foundation.md) to understand the initial infrastructure requirements
2. Set up the Terraform environment following the [Terraform Setup Guide](./terraform-setup.md)
3. Deploy the Phase 1 infrastructure and core services
4. Proceed through subsequent phases as each is completed and validated

## Estimated Timeline

The complete deployment process is estimated to take 40-56 weeks, depending on resource availability and complexity. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with potential for overlap between later stages of one phase and early stages of the next.

| Phase | Description | Timeline | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Foundation Infrastructure | 8-12 weeks | None |
| 2 | Data Pipeline & Analysis | 11-15 weeks | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Visualization & UI | 11-15 weeks | Phase 2 |
| 4 | Production Readiness | 10-14 weeks | Phase 3 |

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- DevOps Engineer(s): 1-2
- Backend Developer(s): 2-3
- Frontend Developer(s): 1-2
- Data Engineer(s): 1-2
- UI/UX Designer: 1

### Infrastructure (GCP)

- GKE Cluster: 3+ nodes (e2-standard-4 or equivalent)
- High-memory nodes for database: 1+ nodes (e2-highmem-8 or equivalent)
- Cloud Storage: Multiple buckets for assets, backups
- Memorystore (Redis): 4+ GB instance
- Pub/Sub: Multiple topics and subscriptions
- Cloud SQL: For relational data storage (optional)

## Cost Considerations

The deployment leverages GCP's free tier where possible, but some components will incur costs. Estimated monthly costs will vary by phase:

- Phase 1: $200-500/month
- Phase 2: $500-1000/month
- Phase 3: $800-1500/month
- Phase 4: $1000-2000+/month

Cost optimization strategies are outlined in the [Terraform Setup Guide](./terraform-setup.md).

## Next Steps

After reviewing this documentation:

1. Assemble the development team
2. Set up the GCP project and enable required APIs
3. Configure the Terraform environment
4. Begin Phase 1 deployment
