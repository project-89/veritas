## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd nx-monorepo/veritas-nx
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Applications**:
   ```bash
   npx nx run-many --target=build --all
   ```

3. **Test the Applications in Browser**:
   ```bash
   npx nx serve api
   npx nx serve visualization
   ```

4. **Verify Visualization Components**:
   - Check that all visualization components render correctly
   - Test interactions with the components
   - Ensure data flows correctly between components

5. **Implement Comprehensive Tests**:
   - After verifying components in the browser, implement proper tests
   - Add unit tests for component functionality
   - Add integration tests for component interactions

6. **Complete Backend Migration**:
   - Migrate remaining NestJS modules to their respective libraries
   - Configure the API application to use the migrated modules

7. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the new project structure
   - Provide instructions for development, testing, and deployment

## Testing Approach

For the initial migration, we've taken a pragmatic approach to testing:

1. **Simplified Component Tests**: We've created simple placeholder tests for all visualization components since they haven't been tested in the browser yet. This allows us to focus on getting the migration completed and ensuring the components work properly in the browser before investing time in comprehensive tests.

2. **Test Co-location**: Following Nx best practices, all test files are co-located with their implementation files. This makes it easier to find and maintain tests.

3. **Phased Testing Strategy**:
   - **Phase 1 (Current)**: Simple placeholder tests to ensure build process completes
   - **Phase 2**: Browser testing of components to verify functionality
   - **Phase 3**: Implementation of comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - **Phase 4**: Addition of end-to-end tests for critical user flows

This approach allows us to make progress on the migration while ensuring that we have a solid testing strategy for the future.
