# Repository Reorganization

This repository has been reorganized as part of the migration to an Nx monorepo structure.

## Changes Made

1. Original repository files have been moved to the `/old` directory for reference
2. The Nx monorepo structure is now at the root of the repository

## Why This Change?

This reorganization makes the Nx monorepo the new base of the repository, which:

- Simplifies development workflows
- Makes it clearer that the Nx structure is the primary codebase
- Follows standard practices for Nx projects

## Accessing Original Files

If you need to reference the original repository structure, you can find all files in the `/old` directory.
